      <p>Hi, my name is Richa Naniwadekar (pronounced "naan-eww-day-cur") and Iâ€™m a budding graphic designer in the Bay Area. 
      My passion to find creativity in everything sparked my interest in design. My strength lies in illustrating, branding, building corporate identity, application and website design. 
      I am currently pursuing an A.A in Graphic Design from De Anza College and looking forward to enhance my design skills in the field.
      I am a travel bug and grab every opportunity I can to plan a trip! Please feel free to contact me by leaving a message below.
